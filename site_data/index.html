          <h1>Sebastian Leonard</h1>
          <h2 class="tagline">Web Developer/Designer in the making!</h2>

          <p>Everything on this website was designed and written by myself. I am extremely passionate about Music & Arts, but that doesn't stop me from working diligently on my coding skills. I've proven myself incredibly adaptable over the years, learning new skills at various workplaces and from schooling.</p>
          <p>I'm interested in pursuing Web Design, Web Development, Data Analysis, and other technology-oriented jobs. I'm willing to step outside of my comfort zone and become better than who I am today.</p>

              <p>At The UPS Store, it was my job to handle tracking, designing, and ordering materials for customers print requests.
