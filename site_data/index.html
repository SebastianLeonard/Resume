            <h3>Vicious Cycles (School assignment)</h3>
            <p>This was my first real dive into building and designing websites, it's certainly rough around the edges, but what came out with only the most fundamental concepts and only barely understanding good design is proof of how much farther I can go.</p>

            <p>At The UPS Store, it was my job to handle tracking, designing, and ordering materials for customers print requests. I dealt with image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and utilized high-end printers to print the given job. It also taught me how to handle the selling process and how to properly price indivdualized projects based on costs of materials and supplies necessary.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I handled packages and provided shipping labels for customers, handled numerous Amazon returns, and packed shipments that needed additional packaging. There were also some specialized requests like passport photographs and laminations that were also performed as requested.</p>
